                    <h2>Obidence Training</h2>
                    <p>We focus on clear communication between you and your dog, using cues, body language, and positive
                        reinforcement to build trust and consistency. It's not just about commands — it’s about learning
                        how to live together with mutual respect.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Behavior Consolutation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every behavior tells a story. Whether your dog is anxious, reactive, or simply struggling in
                        certain situations, we work together to uncover the “why” behind the behavior — and create a
                        plan that meets your dog where they are.

                    <h2>Rehablitation</h2>
                    <p>
                        For dogs carrying fear, trauma, or long-standing stress patterns, we offer patient,
                        individualized support. Rehabilitation is never rushed — we move at your dog’s pace to help them
                        feel safe, confident, and capable again.
