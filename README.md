# DogPaw – Dog Behavior Support Website

DogPaw is a personal project that combines two parts of who I am: someone who codes, and someone who helps dogs. I built this website to share the kind of dog behavior support I offer, focused on communication, trust, and long-term change rather than obedience tricks.

I’ve always had a soft spot for dogs that are reactive, anxious, or misunderstood. Helping them feel safe and seen is something I care deeply about. DogPaw is my way of turning that passion into a real space, and it’s also the first time I’ve used my HTML and CSS skills for something that truly matters to me.

## Motivation

This project started as a creative reset. I needed a break from backend-heavy work and wanted to build something visual, meaningful, and personal. Designing it in Figma was more challenging than I expected. Coming up with a layout on the spot that reflects your values is harder when it matters to you. To help myself through that, I studied popular trainer and wellness websites. It gave me a better understanding of how trust and warmth are communicated through design, and how to apply those lessons to my own project.

## Status

Currently not published. This is an early prototype and will be redesigned and refined before going live.  
It’s a passion project I work on during downtime or until I become a professional dog trainer (joking—I really want a programming job).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3

## Future Plans
